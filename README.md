Within the European INDECIS project, benchmarking experiments of daily data homogenization methods were performed with Climatol, ACMANT and DAP (in 2019). In the website of the project only a brief summary of the results is available (http://www.indecis.eu/docs/Benchmarking.pdf). Here the full set of the results can be seen.
